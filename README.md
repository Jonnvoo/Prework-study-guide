# <Prework-Study-Guide Webpage>

## Description
I created this webpage to help me prepare for my coding Bootcamp. It helps me keep all my notes in one spot. It also contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It has the basics on the topic as of now. I learned how to incorporate all these different languages into an HTML file. It helped me practice coding in these languages as well as how to move my code to Git hub. I solved many problems while going through the steps in making my webpage. Some examples are having text not appear in boxes and having the png of the cat not appear on the page.
